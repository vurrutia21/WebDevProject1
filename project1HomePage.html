        <p>Our love for cheese started at a very young age. Our love for wine started at 21 years old (obviously) when we found that cheese and wine were the best duos known to mankind. Vanessa's Wine Bar was created to bring two loves together and share them with the rest of New York City. We aspire to bring you the best wine and cheese combos in the tri-state area.</p>
